# FedoraWM
This is my install of the alternative install of Fedora as found at https://alt.fedoraproject.org/ using the 'Everything' 
install and using the window manager install and then adding Xmonad and Spectrwm.

This is an ongoing project for me and use at your own risk.

All licenses are by the software creators and any that are my property belong to the community.
